# Construct a class Employee with attributes like emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, and
# emp_department and methods like calculate_emp_salary, emp_assign_department, and
# print_employee_details.
# Sample Employee Data:
# "RAHUL", "E7876", 50000, "ACCOUNTING"
# "PRAKASH", "E7499", 45000, "RESEARCH"
# "ADAM", "E7900", 50000, "SALES"
# "SMITH", "E7698", 55000, "OPERATIONS"
# Use 'assign_department' method to change the department of an employee.
# Use 'print_employee_details' method to print the details of an employee.
# Use 'calculate_emp_salary' method takes two arguments: salary and hours_worked, which is
# the number of hours worked by the employee. If the number of hours worked is more than 50,
# the method computes overtime and adds it to the salary. Overtime is calculated as following
# formula:
# overtime = hours_worked â€“ 50
# Overtime amount = (overtime * (salary / 50))
